# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- master

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:

  # Sets FOO to "some value", then mark it as output variable
  - bash: |
      FOO="some value"
      echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=FOO;isOutput=true]$FOO"
    name: mystep

  # Show output variable in the same job
  - bash: |
      echo "$(mystep.FOO)"
